        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that contain data and methods. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors (methods) common to all objects of that type.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values for the properties defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction hides complexity and shows only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation binds data and methods together and restricts direct access to some components.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc., are special methods used to define behavior for built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent), promoting reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, often using method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers like private (__var), protected (_var), and public (var) variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method __init__() that gets called automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods use @classmethod and take cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, you can use default arguments or *args and **kwargs to simulate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding is redefining a method in the child class that already exists in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "@property allows you to access methods like attributes. It is used to implement getters/setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "It promotes flexibility and extensibility by allowing different object types to be accessed through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class (from abc module) contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",

        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class variable is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__: Returns a developer-friendly string for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "super() is used to call a method from the parent class, especially in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod does not take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod takes cls and can modify the class state.\n",

        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Through method overriding, child classes provide specific implementations of methods defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, usually by returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "__call__ makes an instance callable like a function. It allows objects to behave like functions"
